# Smart Resume Screener

A full-stack web app that helps candidates match their resumes to job descriptions using AI.  
It doesn‚Äôt just give you a number‚Äîit gives you insights: what skills you're missing, what you've nailed, and how your experience stacks up for the role.  
This project is built to feel like a real-world tool you'd actually use during a job hunt‚Äîbecause, well, I‚Äôve been there.

## Tech Stack

| Layer       | Tech Used                             |
|-------------|----------------------------------------|
| Frontend    | React, TailwindCSS, TypeScript         |
| Backend     | Spring Boot (Java), PostgreSQL         |
| AI Service  | Flask (Python), Google Gemini API      |
| DevOps      | Docker, GitHub Actions, Swagger (OpenAPI) |
| Deployment  | AWS (ECS, RDS, ALB, etc.)              |

## How It Works

1. User uploads resume + job description  
2. Spring Boot backend sends them to a Flask-based AI microservice  
3. Flask service calls Google Gemini API with a custom prompt  
4. Response is parsed into:
   - Strengths/weaknesses  
   - Matching skills  
   - Keywords  
   - Score + explanation  
5. Results are stored and shown in the dashboard
